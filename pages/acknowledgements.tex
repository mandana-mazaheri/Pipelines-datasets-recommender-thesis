\begin{acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, 
Prof. Tristan Glatard, from the Department of Computer Science and 
Software Engineering at Concordia University, for the patient guidance, 
useful comments, valuable feedback and advice he has provided 
during my master program. 
I am glad and consider myself lucky to have a chance to work 
with a knowledgeable, motivated professor who really cared about 
his students' research. 

I also would like to extend my gratitude to Val\'erie Hayot-Sasson, 
a very kind and helpful colleague, for her support throughout this research. 
This thesis could have not been done without her knowledge and contributions. 

I would like to thank to all the co-authors of the paper, Dr. Casanova from 
University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa, Dr. Ferreira da Silva from University of Southern California, 
Dr. Christopher Steele from Concordia University, for their conscientious help 
to complete the paper. 

It is also my great pleasure to work with all the members in Big Data 
Infrastructure for Neuroinformatics Laboratory at Concordia University, 
who are nice and helpful colleagues, who helped me to quickly adapt to 
the environment in the laboratory as well as the university. 

I also thank to Concordia University and, again, Prof. Tristan Glatard for 
giving me the opportunity to do my master and have a valuable 
studying time in the university.
